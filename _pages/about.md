Greetings! I am Rong Jin, an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/). My research interests include:
* Multimedia Interactions and systems (VR/AR, simulation, 3D collaboration, EdTech, HealthTech, QoE assessment, serious games)
* Data-driven Computation (mathematical modeling, optimization, graph data mining, machine learning/deep learning)
* Social Computing (social network analysis, computational influence maximization, rumor source detection)
* Computer Vision

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, where I worked in the [Data Communication and Data Management (DCDM) Laboratory](https://theory.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/wu-weili/) and [Prof. Ding-Zhu Du](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/du-ding-zhu/). 
Before that, I was a research assistant working on the creation of tele-immersive virtual collaborative learning environments for learning science subjects in the [Multimedia Systems Laboratory](http://cs.utdallas.edu/multimedialab/) led by [Prof. Balakrishnan Prabhakaran](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~praba/), and I also worked on the modeling and development of <i>Scaffolded Training Environment for Physics Problem-solving</i> [(STEPP)](https://stepp.utdallas.edu/) in the [Creative Automata Lab](https://vimeo.com/89000338) led by [Prof. Paul Fishwick](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/fishwick-paul/). Further before, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications (NUPT), China.


<!--#### Student Assistant Position Available -->
<!-- <p><small> I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate and graduate students in the Computer Science program with strong interests in the above subjects as well as looking to work on research for course credit. If you would like to get involved with my research, take my class Seminar/Project CS first and make an excellent preliminary work. If you have not taken the class but are generally interested, I will typically give you a small project to work on in your spare time. Minimum time commitment for this position is one year. The financial support is considered after a certain probationary period. -->
