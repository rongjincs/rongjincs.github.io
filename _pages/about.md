Greetings! I am Rong Jin.

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I was working in the Social Network Research Group within the [Data Communication and Data Management Laboratory](https://theory.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~weiliwu/) and [Prof. Ding-Zhu Du](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dzdu/). Before then, I worked as research assistant in collaboration with the [Multimedia Systems Laboratory](http://cs.utdallas.edu/multimedialab/) led by [Prof. Balakrishnan Prabhakaran](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~praba/) and the [Creative Automata Lab](https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/creative-automata-lab/) led by [Prof. Paul Fishwick](https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/fishwick-paul/). Further before, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering in [Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/en/).
