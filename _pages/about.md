# About Me 
* I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) , where I am working in the Social Network Research Group within the [Data Communication and Data Management Laboratory](https://theory.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~weiliwu/) and [Prof. Ding-Zhu Du](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dzdu/). 
* Before that, I worked as research assistant in collaboration with the [Multimedia Systems Laboratory](http://cs.utdallas.edu/multimedialab/) led by [Prof. Balakrishnan Prabhakaran](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~praba/) and the [Creative Automata Lab](https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/creative-automata-lab/) led by [Prof. Paul Fishwick](https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/fishwick-paul/). Further before, I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Communications Engineering in [Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/en/).
