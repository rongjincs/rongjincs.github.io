# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. Candidate in in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) , advised by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~weiliwu/). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://rongjinutd.github.io/files/rongjin_cv.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ONLyEOkAAAAJ&hl=en)]  
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/en/).


# Research Interests
* My research interests lie in the general area of data science and machine learning, particularly in data-driven computation, optimization, approximation algorithms and deep learning as well as their applications in online social networks analysis and big data analysis. Besides that, I am also interested in multimedia systems, virtual reality and STEM education.
