Greetings! I am Rong Jin.

I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/). 
I am now an affiliated member of the [TuffyVerse Lab](https://tuffyverse.com/tuffyverse-lab) and the [CEDDI Lab](https://www.sampsonakwafuo.com/ceddi-lab). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, where I worked in the [Data Communication and Data Management (DCDM) Laboratory](https://theory.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/wu-weili/) and [Prof. Ding-Zhu Du](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/du-ding-zhu/). 
Before then, I was a research assistant working on tele-immersive virtual and simulated collaborative learning environments for learning topics in science in the [Multimedia Systems Laboratory](http://cs.utdallas.edu/multimedialab/) led by [Prof. Balakrishnan Prabhakaran](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~praba/) and the [Creative Automata Lab](https://vimeo.com/89000338) led by [Prof. Paul Fishwick](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/fishwick-paul/). Further before, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications (NUPT), China.


### Research Interests include:
* Multimedia systems (VR/AR, collaborative learning, serious games, QoE assessment, modeling & simulation)
* Computational online social networks (computational influence problems, rumor source detection, measurement and algorithm design, optimization)
* Data science (graph data mining, machine learning/deep learning, data-driven computation)
* Artificial Intelligent and Computer Vision


<!--#### Student Assistant Position Available -->
<!-- <p><small> I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate and graduate students in the Computer Science program with strong interests in above subjects as well as looking to work on research for course credit. If you would like to get involved with my research, take my class Seminar/Project CS first and make an excellent preliminary work. If you have not taken the class but are generally interested, I will typically give you a small project to work on in your spare time. Minimum time commitment for this position is one year. The financial support is considered after a certain probationary period. -->
