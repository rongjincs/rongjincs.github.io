Greetings! I am Rong Jin.

I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/). 
I am now affiliated with the [TuffyVerse Lab](https://tuffyverse.com/tuffyverse-lab) and the [CEDDI Lab](https://www.sampsonakwafuo.com/ceddi-lab). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas, where I worked in the [Data Communication and Data Management (DCDM) Laboratory](https://theory.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Weili Wu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~weiliwu/) and [Prof. Ding-Zhu Du](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dzdu/). 
Before then, I was a research assistant affiliated with the [Multimedia Systems Laboratory](http://cs.utdallas.edu/multimedialab/) and the [Creative Automata Lab](https://atec.utdallas.edu/content/creative-automata-lab/), where I worked on 2D/3D technology for STEM education domain learning and training. Further before, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China.

### Research Interests
* Data Science (graph data mining, data-driven computation, machine learning)
* Social Computing (computational influence problems, measurement and algorithm design & analysis, submodular optimization)
* Multimedia Systems (VR/AR/MR/XR applications, QoE, Interactive modeling & simulation)

#### Student Assistant Position Available
<p><small> I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate and graduate students in the Computer Science program with strong interests in above subjects as well as looking to work on research for course credit. If you would like to get involved with my research, take my class Seminar/Project CS first and make an excellent preliminary work. If you have not taken the class but are generally interested, I will typically give you a small project to work on in your spare time. Minimum time commitment for this position is one year. The financial support is considered after a certain probationary period.
