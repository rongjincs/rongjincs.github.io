<h3>Welcome!</h3>
The <i>Digital Realities & Data Science (DRDS)</i> group makes digital reality systems and harnesses digital data to develop algorithmic and machine learning solutions to enhance decision-making across various systems. We conduct research projects in virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D simulation, serious games, collaboration systems, intelligent systems, machine learning, and computer vision. Our projects have applications to science and engineering training and education, clinic healthcare, and problems related to online social networks.<br>
