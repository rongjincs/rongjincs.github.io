## Abstract
We are a year into the development of a software tool for modeling and simulation (M&S) of 1D and 2D kinematics
consistent with Newton’s laws of motion. Our goal has been to introduce modeling and computational thinking into learning high-school physics. 
There are two main contributions from an M&S perspective: (1)the use of conceptual modeling, and (2) the application of Finite
State Machines (FSMs) to model physical behavior. Both of these techniques have been used by the M&S community to model highlevel “soft systems” and discrete events. 
However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals. We also
describe the development of the three STEPP modules, the server architecture, the assessment plan, and the expected outcomes.
